            <h2>A few words about the Ukrenergo without the numbers and unnecessary information, and during the war</h2>

            <P>
                The personnel of Ukrenergo fights with enemy at energy front and at the real front the same as the army of Ukraine.    
            </P>

            <p>
                The first photo in this post shows the moment when the Ukrenergo repair crew is repairing a severed high-voltage line in      the Chornobyl exclusion zone in March, while the occupiers are causing new damage. Our people worked in such conditions for weeks to restore power to the Chornobyl NPP, spent nuclear fuel storage and other special facilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                At that time, the occupiers allowed the brigade to have one phone for everyone, in order to take pictures of the work done and report that they had left the occupied territory. But it was possible to call only after the boys entered the territory controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. <br> In the conditions of war, any random trifle can override all agreements "from above" about "green" corridors, military escort, etc. During one of the first trips to the occupied territory, despite a whole bunch of approvals of routes, lists of people, code words and rules, at one of the checkpoints, the occupiers pulled the brigade out of the car and put them face down on the ground. They were angered by the GPS beacon. Probably, like asphalted roads in the villages, washing machines and computers in every Ukrainian house, this seemed like an unprecedented luxury to the Russians: they could not believe that a simple repair pickup could be equipped with GPS. <br>The occupiers interrogated the boys, shot over their heads, and stole tools and grounding from the car, and were very happy to get away with a chainsaw. In the end, after negotiations, our people were released. In the future, all repairs to the Chernobyl zone were planned as a high-level special operation to protect people's lives. <br>In such conditions, Ukrenergo electricians had to examine more than 100 km of lines, find damage and reliably eliminate them. While repairs were being made in one place, shelling tore the line in other places. But, as Serhiy Shikeryavy says, at that time our guys did not see obstacles, but only their goal - to restore power to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and spent nuclear fuel storage facilities. The residents of the city of Slavutych (about 25,000 residents in peacetime), who were also without electricity all this time, were also waiting for their help. <br>Now the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is reliably powered up. And this is only a part of the history of those days. The further from those events and the closer to our Victory, we will be able to tell more.

                And now the threat of a new nuclear disaster is looming in the south of Ukraine. <br>It's the largest Nuclear Power Plant in the Europe. <br>This work for us...
